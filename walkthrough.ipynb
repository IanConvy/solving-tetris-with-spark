    "Tetris is arguably the most popular video game ever made, having seen countless releases on virtually every piece of computer hardware imaginable. The game was originally developed by Alexey Pajitnov in 1985, and requires the player to stack a set of falling pieces called \"tetrominos\" into a continuous tower, such that there are no gaps between the pieces. Points are scored by filling in an entire row of blocks, at which point those blocks are removed from the board and the height of the tower is reduced. The game ends when the player is unable to clear rows fast enough and allows the tower to reach the top of the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of Tetris comes from the shapes of the tetrominos, which consist of all seven polygons that can be built from four equally-sized square blocks. These pieces can be rotated and translated as they fall, with the player needing to interlock them together into a continuous stack in order to clear rows. Since the order of the pieces is random and unknown to the player, an optimal strategy must consider not only the placement of the current piece, but also how the next piece (and all subsequent pieces) can be incorporated into the tower. The overarching goal is to ensure that each piece fits with the previous pieces to form a continuous surface devoid of holes, so that rows can be cleared. This is the challenge that we wish to \"solve\" using an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"solve\" is presented here in quotes because our goal is not to find the optimal strategy in its entirety. Instead, we seek only an optimal strategy for stacking pieces until it is impossible to prevent a hole from forming somewhere in the tower. In a real game of Tetris this does not cause play to end, as there are ways of repairing these holes and continuing the stack. By focusing solely on continuous piece stacking, we drastically reduce the complexity of the problem, making it possible to find strong solutions with reasonable computational resources. "

    "To pin down the overall complexity of this problem, we must define the height and width of the area where we are allowed to stack pieces (referred to as the *board*). In standard Tetris the board is 20 blocks high and 10 blocks across, but for maximum scoring it is common to initially leave the left-most column unfilled while stacking. This means that the maximum effective play area is 20 x 9, which can fit 21^9 = 794,280,046,581 differently-shaped piece stacks inside of it. In general, the number of possible stacks is given by (*height* + 1)^*width*, since each column can have a number of blocks in the range [0, *height*], and there are *width* distinct columns with their own independent configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each tower configuration, we will need to consider all of the possible ways that the tetrominos can be stacked on top without creating any holes. There is no simple formula for this quantity, as it is highly dependent on the specific contours of the stack. A more concrete quantity to consider is the maximum number of pieces that can be placed in a sequence. Since no piece can be placed when the board is completely full, and since each piece has four blocks, we can stack at most *height* * *width* / 4 pieces before completely running out of room. The full 20 x 9 board, for example, can have at most 45 pieces in any sequence, although most towers will terminate significantly earlier than this."

    "Since Tetris is a game with incomplete information (the sequence of pieces), we will seek a strategy that maximizes the average performance over all sequences. Our measure of performance will be the number of pieces stacked before a hole is formed, with an optimal strategy maximizing this number. Such a strategy can be found via recursion by computing a set of sequence-limited averages, up to the maximum number that can fit on the board. The optimal strategy is then to place each piece such that you end up with a tower configuration that has the highest expected stack length, conditioned on the remaining number of pieces that can be stacked before filling the board.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Compute the probability that the next piece in the sequence will be possible to stack without creating a hole. This is the average number of placed pieces for a sequence of length 1.\n",

    "For step 1 of the algorithm, we need to compute all of the different ways that a starting tower configuration can transition to a different configuration after placing a piece. To do this, we start by defining two different ways to represent a Tetris board. Since we are only interested in towers without holes, we can describe each configuration uniquely by listing out the height of each column. This array-based representation can be compressed into a single integer (which we will call the *board id*) by adding together powers of the board height. For a standard height of 20, we construct an integer that is 21^0 = 1 times the height of the first column, 21^1 = 21 times the height of the second column, 21^2 = 441 times the height of the third column, and so on. This ensures that each board has a single unique integer that represents it. The code which converts between these two representations is given below."
